    <h2>Airports</h2>
    <p>There are two airports within 1 hour of downtown Toronto. They are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Toronto Pearson (YYZ): 30 minutes from downtown.</li>
      <li>Toronto Island / Billy Bishop (YTZ): 10 minutes from downtown.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unless you are travelling from the East Coast of North America, it is most likely that you will find flights into Pearson instead of Billy Bishop.</p>
